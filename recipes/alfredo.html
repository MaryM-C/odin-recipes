            I experimented with Alfredo sauce until I found a quick, cheap, and easy Alfredo

                <h3>Prep</h3>
                <p>
                    Before you start making the sauce, go ahead and prep any other ingredients 
                    you'll be using in your dish (like pasta and chicken). Your sauce will be  ready 
                    to toss and serve as soon as it's done cooking
                </p>

                <h3>Cook</h3>
                <p>
                    Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, then whisk in the cream cheese and garlic powser. 
                    When the first three ingredients form a smooth sauce, start gradually whisking the milk in to the
                    mixture. It's important to add the milk and a little at a time to prevent lumps and 
                    to ensure a thick texture.

                    Add the cheese  and pepper last. Stir the sauce until it's smooth and glossy.

                <h3>Toss</h3>
                <p>
                    Toss the sauce with pasta, chicken, and/or other ingredients that are necessary for your dish. Serve
                    immediately.
